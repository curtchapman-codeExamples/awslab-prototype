### Node/AWS Integration - Proof of Concept for Client

**Status:** Offline/Code Example Only
**URL:** [none]
<br/> <br/> 
A prototype developed for a Client to demonstrate my ability to launch a user specific cloud computing architecture containing a hosted website in AWS, all the while providing feedback to the User in a separate Web App in real time via client side JavaScript. Details of the instance also needed to be stored on a no-SQL database.   

Included in this repo is the main code for the client-side to make back-end calls and animate the display, the server-side code and the lambda functions that are called from AWS, written in Python at the clients request.

Credentials and environmental variables have been removed from this code and hosted databases no longer used. This repo serves purely for the purpose of the examination of the codes layout and theoretical technical application.
